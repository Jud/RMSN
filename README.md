Reading Message Server (RMSN)
=============================
Built for and currently powering [Reading.am](http://reading.am).
Intended as a drop-in replacement for [Pusher](http://pusher.com),
specifically on [Heroku](http://www.heroku.com) but generally anywhere.
Powered by [now.js](http://nowjs.com) on top of [node.js](http://nodejs.org)

Application Server
------------------
There are two environment variables that need to be set:

* `SECRET` - the token that will be used to validate your requests
* `REDIRECT_URL` - the url that GET requests will be redirected to
* `SOCKETS_OFF` true (default) | false - turn off websockets as a
  transport option

Client API
----------
###now.ready();
It's important to note that you'll probably need to wrap your code in a
`now.ready(function(){});` function call. If you're seeing errors like
`Object has no method 'subscribe'` it's because your code is being executed
before nowjs has a chance to load and sync up all its methods. Only the
code that accesses RMSN immediately on page load needs this wrapper.

Publisher APIs
--------------
###Ruby Gem
RMSN works with the standard [Pusher Gem](https://github.com/pusher/pusher-gem),
just follow these simple steps:

* Install the gem using `gem install pusher` or add it to your `Gemfile`
  with `gem 'pusher'`
* Configure the gem using the [url method](https://github.com/pusher/pusher-gem/blob/master/lib/pusher.rb#L50)
  with the scheme `http://KEY:SECRET@example.com/apps/APP_ID`.  
  An example configuration in `config/environments/development.rb` of a
  Rails application might look like this:  
  `Pusher.url = 'http://123qweasd1123qweasd1:098poilkj0098poilkj0@rmsn.example.com/apps/1234'`
* If you're using Heroku, make sure to remove the Pusher add-on, otherwise
  your configuration will more than likely be overwritten by the add-on
  when you deploy to production.

Deploying to Heroku
-----------------
Heroku doesn't allow websockets at the moment so [deploying will require
opting out of that connection option](https://twitter.com/#!/NowJsTeam/status/115861105032708096) by setting SOCKETS_OFF to true:

`heroku config:add SOCKETS_OFF=true`

* Create your Heroku app `heroku create --stack cedar`
* Setup your NODE_ENV variable for Express `heroku config:add NODE_ENV=production`
* Push the code to master `git push heroku master`

Additional instructions for running Node.js applications on Heroku can
be [found here](http://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/node-js).

RMSN
----
RMSN, the acronym, is an homage to [Shipping News](http://www.shippingnews.org),
a seminal band from the birthplace of post-rock â€“ Louisville KY.
You've been done a disservice by your friends and your family if this is
the first mention of Shipping News that you've come across,
especially here in the age of real time messaging systems.

Shipping News' [Kyle Crabtree](http://history.louisvillehardcore.com/index.php?title=Kyle_Crabtree) is one of the most tasteful and nuanced
drummers in music today. His timing is, surely, even better than that 
of the humble Reading Message Server; we strive to replicate his timing.
It's critical that you listen to Shipping News while implementing RMSN.
In fact, the entire thing hinges on it.
