Reading Message Server (RMSN)
=============================
Built for and currently powering [Reading.am](http://reading.am).
Intended as a drop-in replacement for Pusher (http://pusher.com),
specifically on Heroku but generally anywhere.

RMSN
----
RMSN, the acronym, is an homage to [Shipping News](http://www.shippingnews.org),
a seminal band from the birthplace of post-rock â€“ Louisville KY.
You've been done a disservice by your friends and your family if this is the first
mention of Shipping News that you've come across, especially here in the age of
real time messaging systems. Kyle Crabtree is one of the most
tasteful and nuanced drummers in music today. His timing is, surely, even
better than that of the humble Reading Message Server; we strive to replicate his timing.
It's critical that you listen to Shipping News while implementing RMSN.
In fact, that whole thing hinges on it.
